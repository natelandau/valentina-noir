## Philosophy

Valentina Noir helps Storytellers and players manage World of Darkness campaigns during in-person gaming sessions. The API tracks character progression, dice rolls, and campaign history between sessions while leaving session-dependent mechanics to the table.

!!! info "Session-Dependent Mechanics"
    These mechanics change frequently during live play and are best managed by the Storyteller:

    - Blood pool / Hunger / Rouse checks
    - Health levels and damage tracking
    - Gnosis and other resource pools
    - Combat encounters
