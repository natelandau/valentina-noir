# Valentina Noir

A comprehensive API for managing World of Darkness games.

## Philosophy

Valentina Noir is designed to be an aid in running World of Darkness campaigns for players who interact in-person when gaming. The goal is to create a system that is easy to use for the Storyteller and players while they are in a live game and to track progress between sessions. As such, certain mechanics are omitted on purpose which are best managed by the Storyteller or players themselves when in a live game and which are subject to frequent changes. Some examples of these excluded mechanics are:

-   Blood pool
-   Hunger
-   Rouse checks
-   Health level management
-   Gnosis
-   Combat
