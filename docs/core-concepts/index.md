# Core Concepts

To build your api client, you will need to understand the core concepts that make up the Valentina Noir API.

-   **Developers (You)** - Each developer is granted an API key to access the Valentina Noir API. This key is used to determine the authorized actions that can be performed on the API. There is no limit to the number of applications that can be created using your API key.

-   **[Companies](../development/companies/)** - Companies are the foundational entity in Valentina Noir. Each company is a distinct entity with its own set of users, campaigns, and characters, etc.

-   **[End Users](../development/user-management/)** - End users are the players and storytellers who interact with the Valentina Noir API. They are the ones who create and manage characters, campaigns, and other resources.

-   **Campaigns** - Storytellers can create Campaigns which are distinct worlds which can contain many story arcs, characters, and span multiple time periods. Campaigs are split into **books** which track a singular theme or storyline. Books are, in turn, split into **chapters** which represent individual gaming sessions. Characters, NPCs, experience, and other aspects of the game are tracked at the campaign level.

-   **[Characters](../core-concepts/characters/)** - Characters are the players and NPCs in a campaign.

## Customized World of Darkness System

Valentina Noir is based on a customized version of the World of Darkness system. The changes from the canonical World of Darkness system are the result of a long running campaign that has been in progress in some form or another for over 30 years. Notable changes include:

-   [Dice rolling system](rolling-dice/)
-   [Experience system](experience/)
