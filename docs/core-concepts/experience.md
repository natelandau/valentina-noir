# Experience

In Valentina Noir, experience is granted to the player, not to specific characters, and is tracked at the campaign level. Players may play multiple characters and are able to share their experience between them.

Experience can be spent on the following:

-   **Character Advancement** - Upgrading a character's attributes, skills, etc.
-   **Character Augogeneration** - Using the character autogeneration feature to create a new character for use in the campaign.

## Experience Types

Storytellers can grant experience to players in the following ways:

-   **Experience Points** - The basic currency of character advancement.
-   **Cool Points** - Cool points are worth `10` experience points and can be awarded by the Storyteller as a reward to players who have roleplayed exceptionally well.
