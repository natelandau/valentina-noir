# Characters

## Character Permissions

Updating characters and their associated data is restricted to the character owner and company administrators and storytellers.

## Character Creation

There are three ways to create characters in Valentina Noir:

1. **Manually enter the character's details.** Enter each facet and trait of the character one by one.
2. **Autogenerate a single character with random attributes.** This is a quick way to create a character. You can specify the character's class, experience level, skill focus, concept, or you can let the system randomly select everything for you. This is a great option for Storytellers who want to quickly create NPCs.
3. **Autogenerate multiple characters and choose the one you want to keep.** Begin a character creation session where multiple characters are randomly generated. You will be presented with a list the character and given an opportunity to select the one you want to keep. Depending on your Company's settings, this may cost experience points.
