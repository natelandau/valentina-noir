# Characters

Characters represent players and NPCs in your campaigns.

## Character Permissions

Only these users can update characters and their data:

-   Character owner
-   Company administrators
-   Company storytellers

## Character Creation

Create characters using one of three methods:

### Manual Entry

Enter each trait and attribute individually. This method gives you complete control over every aspect of the character.

### Single Autogeneration

Generate a single character with random attributes. You can specify:

-   Character class
-   Experience level
-   Skill focus
-   Concept

Or let the system randomly select everything. This method works well for quickly creating NPCs.

### Multiple Autogeneration

Generate multiple characters and select the one you want to keep. The system presents a list of generated characters for you to review. Select your preferred character to continue.

!!! info "Experience Cost"
    Some companies charge experience points for multiple autogeneration. Check your [company settings](./company_settings.md) for details.
